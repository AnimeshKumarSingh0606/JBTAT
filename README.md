INNOVATION
-----------------------------------
The innovative part of JBTAT (Known as EAT for the JBOSS Servers) is creating the test once and testing with any version of the tested software. It may be firstly applied for the JBOSS Servers, but, in general, a similar structure, can be used for creating tests about any software with multiple versions or for multiple software programs that have a part of the testsuite in common.
